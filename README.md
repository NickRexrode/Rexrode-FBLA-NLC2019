# Rexrode-FBLA-NLC2019
My Coding and Programming Project for the FBLA NLC 2019

A program to manage the issuance of E-Books to a class of students. This program was made for the Coding and Programming Event (FBLA 2019). All of the code in this program except the JDBC library has been created by me, Nick Rexrode. I used the Library to save time on my half. It also is easy to use and understand.

BEFORE RUNNING THE PROGRAM!!!
Be sure that you add the JDBC jar file to the projects build path! This is needed to read and write the data in databases.

I've included the source code. You can either use GitHub to view it, or import it into your IDE to run it  I created this program in Eclipse on a computer with a 1920 x 1080 display.  The Display is important because my constraints have been hit or miss.  I've tried on a few other resolutions which have work; however, it may be distorted on some resolutions.

Inside the Program, there is a help menu, which have tips and tricks about the program.  

I'm always looking for ways to improve my code, so please leave feedback if you can :)

Thanks!

As a side note - My chrome flagged this file as a threat.  I believe the treat comes from the SQL database, or the JDBC.  I'm not an expert but its probably something to do with the Connections that JDBC can make.  The Project is 100% free of any viruses.
